Subject: [PATCH] do not export location for kconf_update
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

kconf_update is not required during buildtime. To avoid failing for cmake
over enthusiastc checking for all imported files we simply don't export and
don't point to native location.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [configuration]
